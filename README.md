# How to get the data
For this project, I used three types of data: the data of the rooftops from here:
https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/eignung-von-hausdachern-fur-die-nutzung-von-sonnenenergie/resource/2446ce7b-8709-42a1-b293-49b48129a5b4
This is geographical and geometrical data of all rooftops in switzerland. Some of them have inproper geometries and they are not associated with a canton or municipality.

Then, the data of the PV devices can be found here:

https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/elektrizitatsproduktionsanlagen/resource/222c10df-57c7-4fe2-a3de-7979eb41260d
Here are also other sources of electric energy generators included.

Then, a geodata file is needed for the borders of the municipals.
