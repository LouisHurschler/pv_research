# current problems:
There are soome PV plant on new built houses which are not in the roof dataframe. Those PV's get lost currently because we are only joining the ones which overlap with a rooftop.
TODO: calculate how many PV plants gets lost during this process

Another problem is that we only know on which house a PV plant is but not on which specific rooftop. We do not have any orientational information about the PV plants.
